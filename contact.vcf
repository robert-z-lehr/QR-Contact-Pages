NOTE:The Sustainable Systems MS/PhD is a cross-disciplinary graduate track run through the CAEE (Civil\, Architectural\, and Environmental Engineering) department at UT Austin. \n\nIts focal theme is the nexus of cities\, water\, and energy. That is\, it emphasizes addressing complex\, interlinked challenges in urban systems\, energy use\, and water (and related environmental interactions).\n\nPossible Research Topics:\n- Integrated urban infrastructure (energy\, water\, waste)\n- Sustainable energy systems (renewables\, grid integration\, demand response)\n- Water reuse\, wastewater\, stormwater\, waterâ€“energy links\n- Life cycle assessment\, system optimization\, modeling of coupled systems\n- Socio-technical factors: policy\, economic incentives\, stakeholder interactions as part of system behavior
